                <h3>Burning Answers</h3>
                <p>
There are most things in life we have (most of us) grown accustomed to and do not expect that at any point in the unimaginable infinity that is life would be snatched away. I found the hard line of that feeling not while I alerted the shared inhabitants of my apartment unit, or while I grabbed up the family cat, or even when at last moment after getting my laptop remembered ,once feeling the terrible cold of the back steps, to also get a pair of shoes to wear outside on a usual New England winter day. It's something that in the quickest of instances and without warning or mercy will utterly kick your ass. I remember very clearly thinking about how damned much the smoke was burning my eyes and about how it was near impossible to look away. 
<br /><br />
I'd never conceived of how helpless a person can be, at how helpless I was. New Years Day left me temporarily homeless. A heating pipe had dried out wood in the walls of my neighbors apartment and at approximately 11am, 40 years after those walls were constructed the dried out wood in their walls caught fire. I was dumbfounded at what was thought necessary for user instruction on earbuds, when, a frantic pounding and a broken english alert at the door startled all of us in my apartment.

We had just said something about how you bring in the New Year is indication for how the year will go. Great. Smoke that comes from a structure fire represents an incredible mix of emotions, if, when closing your eyes and distancing the reality from the situation, you can be subtly reminded of campfires, while what is actually happening is fire-fighers are tearing your apartment to hell, dumping gallons upon gallons of water into the walls, through the ceilings onto all that you had so carefully arranged and placed in its destined place. Destined to be smashed.

We stood even past they had all left, denying news-crews interviews, denying ourselves the acknowledgement of what we had just witnessed. We stood there in the freezing cold and waited to be ushered into the city-bus that came after all the emergency crews had left, they told us we couldn't live there anymore, and we knew this but somehow hearing that made it very real. The insurance forms and displaced housing search have reinforced this fact. The truth is, however, that the rent was just too good and would have kept me stationary. I've never wanted that for myself. We were kicked by this burning answer, this burning building forcing us to move one, to continue searching and find someplace that our roots can spread a little more. Plus, I was really having difficulty choosing a color to paint my walls.
