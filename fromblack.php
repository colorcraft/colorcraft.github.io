                <h3>From the Blackness</h3>
                <p>Black Moods was coined from a period in my life.  Its is named for much the same a Black Hole is and in fact was meant to explain a very similar phenomenon, the obscured knowledge of a vast infinity that conceals itself beyond sight, understanding or even general comprehension.
    <br><br>
    The true meaning of why I came to exist in this blackness is so far gone that undoubtedly it has also become lost in its own depth. A depth that is still a part of who I am and will always be. The creation of this, however, is in celebration of what has now become and is due to the incubation within this blackness. Here now is a celebratory Black Mood. A Yellow Mood. A Cyan Mood. A Rainbow Mood.
    <br><br>
    My intention here is to voice all that was left in the dark, to blossom and express the fluid nature of mood. Black Moods will be a collection of love, loss, the found places and ideas that inspire and incubate for the future.</p>
